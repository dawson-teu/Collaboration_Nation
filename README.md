# Collaboration Nation

A repository for our Collaboration Nation, our team's project for PTC Hacks CodeAgainstCovid.
To run the project, download all the files into one directory. Then run (`npm install`) and run server.js with Node.js (`node server.js`). Then open (`localhost:3000`) in a web browswer.
